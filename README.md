## Project Reflection

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
For this project, I was given starter code files and a Jupyter Notebook with some predefined structure. The PY files contained the base environment for the Treasure Hunt game and the necessary helper functions. I was specifically instructed not to modify the provided PY files. My primary task was to implement the Q-Training Algorithm inside the Jupyter Notebook. I developed the code that allowed the pirate intelligent agent to successfully learn how to navigate the environment and find the treasure using deep Q-learning. This included setting up the neural network model, defining the training loop, managing the replay memory, and tuning the hyperparameters to achieve efficient learning.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing, analyzing, and implementing algorithms and systems that enable machines to perform tasks efficiently. Their work matters because it drives innovation across industries, improves quality of life, and enables society to address complex challenges through technology.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components. I start by understanding the requirements, researching potential solutions, designing a plan, implementing the code systematically, and iteratively testing and refining the solution. Critical thinking, experimentation, and adaptability are key throughout the process.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I have the ethical responsibility to ensure that my solutions are reliable, safe, and respect user privacy. I must prioritize transparency, avoid bias in algorithms, and strive to create technology that benefits society. I am also responsible for maintaining the trust of the organization and its users by adhering to ethical standards in software development and deployment.
